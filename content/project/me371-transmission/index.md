For the final project in a mechanical design course at the University of
Illinois I worked on a team to design a 3-speed transmission, complete with idle
and reverse gears. In the design of this transmission I used fundamental machine
design calculations to determine the proper gear ratios and gear tooth sizing.
This included hand-calculations and finite element simulations to predict the
gear tooth root stress for every gear pairing. In addition to this I predicted
the bearing load for each bearing supporting each shaft to verify that we were
within the bearing specifications.

I fabricated the transmission with a waterjet and performed testing on a rig which was provided to us. Using this we were able to estimate the mechanical efficiencies of each gear pairing.
