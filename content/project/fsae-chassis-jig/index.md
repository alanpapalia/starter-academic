To accurately manufacture the steel-tube spaceframe component of our Formula SAE
car I designed and manufactured a jigging system out of steel sheets. The
jigging was designed such that the frame could be assembled inside the jigging,
welded, and then normalized with an oxy-acetylene torch to reduce thermal
stresses and warpage of the final weldment.
