I am a PhD student in Robotics with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute <a href="https://mit.whoi.edu/"> Joint Program</a>. I'm fortunate to be working alongside great people in the <a href="http://marinerobotics.mit.edu"> Marine Robotics Group</a>, under <a href="https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/JLEONARD@MIT.EDU"> Prof. John Leonard</a>.

I'm excited about the potential of collaborative multi-robot systems in the future of our society. My research seeks to leverage graph theory, probability, and optimization to develop algorithms for multi-robot systems that allow for robots to robustly accomplish tasks in uncertain environments.

Before working in robotics I spent my undergraduate years working with a great group of people on the <a href="https://motorsports.illinois.edu/"> Illini Motorsports Formula SAE </a> team. Here I oversaw a team of over 40 members, engaged in a number of mechanical design projects, and took part in a number of international competitions.

I'm always open to opportunities! Send me an <a href="mailto:alanpapalia@gmail.com"> email </a> or reach out over <a href="//www.linkedin.com/in/alan-papalia-06883b105">LinkedIn</a> if you think our interests match.
